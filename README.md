# **AI-Driven Time Series Prediction & MLOps Demonstration**  

This repository is a **proof of concept** showcasing the integration of a **modern data stack, MLOps practices, and AI models** for time series forecasting. The goal of this project is to demonstrate **end-to-end machine learning workflows**, including data ingestion, model training, deployment, and trend visualization.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only** and is **not intended for real-world financial trading or investment**.

## **System Overview**  

This system consists of multiple components working together to demonstrate AI-driven time series prediction:

### **1. Data Pipeline**  
- Ingests and preprocesses time series data using modern data stack tools.  

### **2. Feature Engineering**  
- Extracts meaningful features from time series data for model training.  

### **3. AI Model Training**  
- Implements ML/DL models such as **LSTMs, ARIMA, Prophet, and Transformer-based models** for forecasting.  

### **4. MLOps Workflow**  
- Utilizes **CI/CD pipelines** for model training, validation, and deployment.  

### **5. Model Monitoring & Drift Detection**  
- Tracks model performance and detects data drift over time.  

### **6. Inference & Prediction Engine**  
- Generates forecasts and trends from trained models.  

### **7. Trend Visualization Dashboard**  
- Displays **time series predictions and insights** using interactive visualizations.
